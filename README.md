# Your GitHub Learn Repository for Merge Conflicts

Welcome to your repository for your GitHub Learn course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm GitHub Learn bot and I'm here to help guide you on your journey of learning and mastering the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact I already added an issue for you to checkout.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

> There are already some Pull Requests open, you will work on those later in the course.
